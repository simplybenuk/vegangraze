    <h1>The Vegan Graze app is no more</h1>
    <p>I'm really sorry, but I have decided to close the Vegan Graze app, as I no longer have the time to keep it updated. With the boom in Veganism
    over the last year or so, I'm confident that Vegan Graze is no longer needed anymore.</p>
    <p>When I started the app, it was because I had turned vegan and was finding it really difficult to find a vegan sandwich on my local highstreet.
    That no longer seems to be a problem as all the major retailers have jumped on board and now there is at least one option on the menu for us to try</p>
    <p>Thanks for all you're support. If you're interested in any of my other projects, please visit my website<a href="http://www.simplyben.co.uk/"> simplyben.co.uk</a></p>
