<p>There was a left over cabbage in the fridge from the previous week&#8217;s Morrisons Wonky Box, and I was struggling to wonder what to do with it. I&#8217;ve added cabbage to my weekly stir-fry, I&#8217;ve had garlic cabbage roasted wedges, and I&#8217;ve made mountains of coleslaw with my big round green friends, so I was looking for something different.</p>
<p>As I was feeling in a particularly naughty mood I thought, let&#8217;s get the oil out and make some fried goodness. Cabbage fritters it was. Easy to make. It was not an exact science this one so trust your judgement.</p>
<p>This recipe made about 10 fritters:</p>
<p><strong>Ingredients</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>1/4 of a large Cabbage</li>
<li>1/2 large onion</li>
<li>1 carrot</li>
<li>Soy Sauce 2 tbsp</li>
<li>Seasoning: Salt, Pepper, Turmeric</li>
<li>Gram flour</li>
<li>Corn flour</li>
<li>Vegetable Oil</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Method</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>I first started by prepping the vegetables. Pretty much the same as I would have done if I was making coleslaw. I got a big mixing bowl and into this went long thin sliced the cabbage onion and grated carrot.</li>
<li>Into the mixing bowl then went the a good pinch of both salt and pepper and approx 1 tsp of turmeric, although you could pretty much season to your favourite flavours. The 2 tbsp of Soy Sauce was added and I mixed this all together.</li>
<li>Here you&#8217;ll have a pretty moist mixture so you then start to add the gram and corn flour 1 tablespoon at a time to the bowl, mixing until you start to see that the mixture is forming a paste around the vegetables. I added 2 tbsp of corn flour for every tbsp of gram flour I added.</li>
<li>When the mixture is ready you should be able to reach your hand in and make patties with the mixture. Make these with the mixture, setting them to one side on a plate whilst you get the oil ready.</li>
<li>If you&#8217;ve got a fryer, great, but if you haven&#8217;t I just added oil to a wok so it formed a shallow puddle and heated it on a medium heat. Once the oil is hot and sizzles when you add a bit of paste from the bowl in, start to add the fritters. I did two at a time and they roughly took about two minutes on each side. Be careful not to burn then, or yourself (you&#8221;re using hot oil don&#8217;t forget).</li>
<li>Once they&#8217;re done, put them on a plate lined with kitchen paper to cool slightly and soak off the excess oil and then enjoy!</li>
