  <p>It's difficult to know where to look for Vegan news, advice, recipes etc. We hope we already have you covered for those quick Vegan Lunches on the go, but there is plenty of other great material on the web to help you make the most of your Vegan lifestyle. We&#8217;ve compiled a list of Vegan website links to sites that have helped us below. Please enjoy and share with your fellow Vegans.</p>
<p>As we're a UK based site these links may be focused to UK Veganism. Sorry, please let me know if you&#8217;d like to something more international.</p>
<p>Something missing from this list? Let me know by emailing at <a href="mailto:ben@vegangraze.com">ben@vegangraze.com</a> or contact us through our social media channels.</p>
<h2>Veganism &amp; News</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.peta.org/"><strong>PETA</strong> </a>&#8211; People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals. Even if the treatment of animals wasn&#8217;t the reason for you becoming Vegan in the first place, the more you look into this, the more you&#8217;ll realise how blinded you were.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.vegansociety.com/"><strong>The Vegan Society</strong></a> &#8211; The mother ship of all things Vegan. Want to know where to start, visit here.</li>
<li><a href="https://veganwomble.co.uk/"><strong>Vegan Womble</strong></a> &#8211; The Vegan Womble has a really good part of their site called the <a href="https://veganwomble.co.uk/supermarket-vegan-lists/">Supermarket Vegan Lists</a>. Here you&#8217;ll find links to all the UK Supermarket&#8217;s Official Vegan lists, but also the extremely helpful Community&#8217;s Unofficial Vegan Lists. Be prepared to be surprised</li>
</ul>
<h2>Vegan Recipe Sites</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://www.bosh.tv/">BOSH!</a></strong> &#8211; I found these after seeing one of their videos on Facebook. They serve up some tasty looking dishes and their recipes are Plant-based &amp; Vegan, Fun &amp; Tasty, and Easy to make.</li>
<li><a href="https://minimalistbaker.com/"><strong>Minimalist Baker</strong></a> &#8211; Although the authors aren&#8217;t entirely vegan, the majority of the recipes (I&#8217;m still to find one that isn&#8217;t) fall into the vegan, gluten free category. They specialise in <em>&#8220;delicious recipes that require just 30 minute or less, 1 bowl, or 10 ingredients to prepare.&#8221;</em></li>
</ul>
<h2>Vegan Brands</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.fryfamilyfood.com/uk/"><strong>Fry Family Food Company (Frys)</strong></a> &#8211; All vegan and some unbelievably good food. Try cooking some of their <a href="http://www.fryfamilyfood.com/uk/pepper-pies/">Pepper &#8220;Steak Style&#8221; Pies</a> for your omnivore friends and see if they can tell that they&#8217;re vegan.</li>
<li><a href="http://lindamccartneyfoods.co.uk/"><strong>Linda McCartney Foods</strong></a> &#8211; Vegetarian &amp; Vegan Food. I don&#8217;t really know how I would exist without the <a href="http://lindamccartneyfoods.co.uk/our-food/frozen-range/vegetarian-sausages/?Vegan">Vegetarian Sausages</a> (which are actually Vegan). A full list of all their Vegan products can be found by <a href="http://lindamccartneyfoods.co.uk/our-food/vegan-range/">clicking here </a></li>
</ul>
