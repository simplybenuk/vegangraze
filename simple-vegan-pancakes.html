<p>I never really ate pancakes. That was until I became vegan. Now they&#8217;re my weekend morning treat. This simple vegan pancake recipe is a doddle to make and is a great start to the weekend.</p>
<p>This recipe makes about 8 to 10 pancakes for stacking:</p>
<p><strong>Ingredients</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>200g plain flour</li>
<li>2 tablespoons caster sugar</li>
<li>2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
<li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
<li>300ml cold water</li>
<li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
<li>More vegetable oil for frying</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Method</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Into a mixing bowl put the flour, caster sugar, baking powder and salt and oil.</li>
<li>Start to mix together until the oil is loosely mixed in (this won&#8217;t take long) then add in the water a little at a time, mixing each splash in fully before you add more.</li>
<li>When you&#8217;ve mixed it all in that there are no visible lumps you&#8217;re batter is ready. I now normally pour the batter from the mixing bowl back into the measuring jug I used to measure out the water. This makes it easier to pour for the pancakes.</li>
<li>Add a little vegetable oil to a frying pan on a medium heat. When hot, pour in some batter to make a pancake. The batter should sizzle as it hits the hot oil.</li>
<li>Leave the batter to cook for about 2 minutes. The uncooked top should start getting little bubble holes in it when ready and more importantly not make a mess when you flip it. Then take a spatula, get fully underneath the pancake, lift and flip. Don&#8217;t worry if you make a mess, it&#8217;ll still be edible.</li>
<li>Once done to your liking on both sides plate up. I personally keep them on a plate in the oven at about 40Â°C whilst I make the others.</li>
<li>Repeat from step 4 until you&#8217;re out of batter (you may need to add a little oil for each pancake, I do as it makes it easier)</li>
<li>Serve with your choice of fresh fruit, sugar, chocolate, syrup, lemon juice, sugar, etc etc then get back to bed as it&#8217;s the weekend!</li>
